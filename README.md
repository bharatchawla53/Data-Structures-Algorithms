## Segement Tree 
          Leaf Nodes are the elements of the input array 
          Each internal node represents some merging of the leaf nodes. The merging may be different for different problems. 
          An array representation of tree is used to represent Segment Trees. For each node at index i, the left child is at index 2*i+1, right child at 2*i+2 and the parent is at st1.
